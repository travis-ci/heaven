# Chat Notifications

Heaven looks for information in the environments and tries to give feedback to chat rooms to everyone knows that code has been deployed. Right now it supports three networks.

All notifications run inside of [resque][3] jobs and need to define a deliver method.

### Example Provider

```ruby
module Heaven
  module Notifier
    class MyChat < Default
      def deliver(message)
      end
    end
  end
end
```
